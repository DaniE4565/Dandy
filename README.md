<h2>Tearing the silence into shreds,<br>

the time has come for us to cross paths,<br>
it's a meeting we were fated to have,<br>
my eyes filled with regret i see you,<br>
clad in anguish,<br>                                                    
<a href="default.html"><img src="../images/YLIA.png" alt="YOUR LIE IN APRIL QUOTE" style="width:500px;height:600px;"> 
   <br> </a>


blossomed beautifully,<br>
i can see the flower bringing joy to people's lives,<br>
can you see it too,<br>
i'm sure you can,<br>
let's paint over all the mistakes we've made,<br>
we'll start over and over again until we suceed,<br>
for the sake of a fresh start,<br>
we'll start realizing  our very own dreams and hopes,<br>
i've never said goodbye,<br>
i never will....</h2></h2>
